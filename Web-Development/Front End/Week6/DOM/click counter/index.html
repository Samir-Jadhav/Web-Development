<!-- Problem statement
Let's make a counter using JavaScript. But it's a bit different; it increases only when you click on a box.

So create a big box in the center of the web page and add a counter below it.

When you click on the box the counter should increases by one.



The image below shows how the web page would look like -
no image


After 5 clicks on the box, the counter should show 5 as shown in image below -
no image -->
